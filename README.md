Number Guessing Game in Java

The task is to write a Java program in which a user will get 5 trials to guess a randomly generated number. 
Below are the rules of the game:

1. If the guessed number is bigger than the actual number, the program will respond with the message that the guessed number is higher than the actual number.
2. If the guessed number is smaller than the actual number, the program will respond with the message that the guessed number is lower than the actual number.
3. If the guessed number is equal to the actual number or if the 5 trials are exhausted, the program will end with a suitable message.
